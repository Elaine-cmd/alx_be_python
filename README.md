# July Work Log

## Python and Git Learning Progress

### Week 1
- Worked on understanding Python basics including variables, functions, and loops.  
- Practiced small coding challenges to strengthen problem-solving skills.  
- Encountered some Git issues such as incorrect commit messages and staging the wrong files, but resolved them by learning how to amend commits and reset stages.  

### Week 2
- Focused on object-oriented programming in Python by creating small projects.  
- Gained a better grasp of classes, methods, and attributes.  
- Faced a merge conflict on Git for the first time and successfully resolved it by reviewing changes carefully before merging.  

### Week 3
- Integrated API requests into Python projects using the requests library.  
- Debugged issues related to API responses and incorrect endpoint usage.  
- Improved Git workflow by committing more frequently with clear messages.  

### Week 4
- Completed a mini-project combining Python skills and Git collaboration.  
- Learned to use branches effectively and practiced merging them without conflicts.  
- Reviewed previous work logs to ensure all challenges and solutions were documented.  

## June Issues Reviewed in July
- Git push failures due to uncommitted changes.  
- Errors when working with Python scripts that lacked necessary user prompts.  
- Missing required constants and variables in assignments.  

This month was about strengthening core Python concepts, improving Git practices, and building the habit of documenting challenges and solutions for future reference.
