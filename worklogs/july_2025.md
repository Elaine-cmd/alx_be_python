## ⚠️ Git & Bash Challenges (June + July)
- ❌ Used `master` instead of `main` → Push failed.
- ❌ Initialized Git in wrong folder → Structure error.
- ❌ Tried to stage a file with a typo (`greetings.txt.`)
- ❌ Confused `mkdir` (folder) vs `touch` (file).
- ✅ Learned correct Git workflow:
  - `git init`, `git branch -M main`, `git add .`, `git commit -m`, `git push`

## ✨ Highlights
- All scripts passed ALX checker ✅
- Understood file creation, redirection & terminal use
- Gained confidence using Git + VS Code in real workflow
