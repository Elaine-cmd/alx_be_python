July Work Log

1. Summary of What I Worked On
- Continued learning backend development at ALX, focusing on Python basics, functions, object-oriented programming, and API integration.
- Worked on Git troubleshooting from issues faced in June.
- Designed and refined USSD flows for farmers in Kenya, improving navigation and accessibility.
- Committed and pushed multiple assignments and small projects to GitHub.

2. Achievements
- Built a small library management system using Python classes.
- Created a Python weather app that fetches data from an online API.
- Solved previous Git merge conflicts and improved my commit workflow.
- Made the USSD navigation tree more user-friendly for first-time users.

3. Lessons from Challenges
- Learned to always check my working directory before staging files to avoid broken pushes.
- Understood the importance of double-checking project requirements before submission.
- Discovered that API calls fail easily if parameters are wrong, and logging responses makes debugging easier.
- Realized that rushing work increases errors, so better time management is key.

4. Monthly Highlights
- Created a simple push method for faster work log updates to GitHub.
- Turned Juneâ€™s Git issues into a quick reference guide for future use.
- Python syntax started to feel more natural.
- Got positive feedback on the clarity of my USSD designs.

5. June Git Issues and Fixes
Issue: Staging from the wrong directory
Fix: Use `pwd` to confirm location before staging. If wrong, navigate to the project root.

Issue: Merge conflicts when pulling
Fix: Use `git stash`, then `git pull origin main`, and `git stash pop`.

Issue: README changes not showing on GitHub
Fix: Make sure the file is tracked with `git add`, commit with a clear message, and push.

Issue: Too many small commits
Fix: Batch related changes into one commit using `git add .` and a single commit message.
