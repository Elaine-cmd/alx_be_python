# **July Worklog — Elaine Waithera**

## **1. Summary of What I Worked On**
- Continued learning backend development at ALX, focusing on Python fundamentals, functions, OOP, and API integration.  
- Worked on Git-related troubleshooting and staging issues from June to refine workflow.  
- Designed and refined USSD flows for farmers in Kenya, incorporating feedback on user navigation and accessibility.  
- Pushed multiple code assignments and mini-projects to GitHub, maintaining proper version history.

## **2. Achievements**
- Successfully implemented an **OOP-based library management system** with class encapsulation.  
- Created a **Python weather app** using the `requests` library and external API calls.  
- Resolved previous Git merge conflicts and staged changes more efficiently.  
- Improved USSD navigation tree to be more intuitive for first-time farmers.

## **3. Learnings from Failures or Challenges**
- Learned the importance of **staging from the correct project root** to avoid broken pushes.  
- Encountered failed script submissions due to missing required prompts — now double-checking checklist requirements before final submission.  
- API calls can fail if parameters are not correctly passed; debugging is easier when logging full error responses.  
- Time management is crucial — rushing led to unnecessary errors.

---

## **4. Monthly Highlights**
- Figured out a **compact, one-paste GitHub worklog push method** for faster updates.  
- Overcame June’s Git issues and turned them into a reusable troubleshooting guide.  
- Reached a point where Python syntax feels more intuitive.  
- Got positive feedback on USSD flow design clarity.

## **5. June Git Issues & Fixes**
Below are the Git-related issues from June that helped improve my July workflow:

### **Issue 1: Not in Project Root When Staging**
- **Problem:** Staging changes from the wrong directory caused pushes to fail.
- **Fix:** Always run  
  ```bash
  pwd
